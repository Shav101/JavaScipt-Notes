    <h1>Hello JavaScript</h1>

    <!-- The reason why the script is in the bottom its 
    because when the page renders in the browser
    there will need to be a order of operations
    
    First the browser is going to load everything in the <head> tag
    
    The reason we have javascript in the bottom is because we dont want it to 
    hang up the page from loading
    -->

    <!-- This is called inline javascript since its within HTML -->
    <script src="index.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <!-- var name = "Shav";
      var lastName = "Jumaev";
      var fullName = name + " " + lastName;
      console.log(fullName); -->
